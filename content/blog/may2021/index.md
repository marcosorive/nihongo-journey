## May 5th

Today I've reviewed the Hiragana syllabary, as I usually do, and started lesson 3 of Genki. I watched around 1/4 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed4rmIY4mL0) which explains verbs much better than the book. I didn't have a lot of time today but at least I understood everything that I heard from the video.
