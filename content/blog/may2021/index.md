## May 5th

Today I've reviewed the Hiragana syllabary, as I usually do, and started lesson 3 of Genki. I watched around 1/4 of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed4rmIY4mL0) which explains verbs much better than the book. I didn't have a lot of time today but at least I understood everything that I heard from the video.

## May 6th and 7th

Very busy days with family events, even with the corona pandemic. I only had time to continue learning the theory about Ichidan verbs and how to use them with the masu form. 

## May 8th

Today it was climbing day with friends basically. Arrived home late and I am tired as hell. No japanese study today, sadly.

## May 9th

Although I am still tired from climbing and my alergies are killing me, I've managed to review the Hiragana syllabary, as usual. I also finished learning about Ichidan verbs and its exceptions. I continued with the two irregular verbs that are in japanese and the negative formal form (~masen). Finally, I started writing flashcards as a new studying method. I wrote 2 cards: for basic _X wa Y desu_ sentences and question sentences. I intend to create vocabulary cards, Grammar, vocabulary... etc. I will probably use flashcards for Kanji as well in the future.
