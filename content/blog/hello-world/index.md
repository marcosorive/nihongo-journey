# Hello!

I'm Marcos and I'm trying to learn japanese. I've actually been trying for some time, with little result. I'm spanish by the way, in case that matters. Not sure if it's easier to learn it when Spanish is your mother tonge.

Anyway, I want to use this blog to log my advancements. Ideally I want to write everyday, just one or two phrases saying what I've done that day. If I've learned some new verbs or grammar, vocabulary, etc I want to just write a little about that. The idea is that it shouldn't feel like a chore that I have to do.

So yeah, that's it! Oh, yes, I'm using Genki 2nd edition to study and following ToKini Andy's videos for better explanations, in case you were wondering.
